# Discourse Event Description Limit Plugin

**Plugin Summary**

This plugin adds a site setting that allows admins to control the maximum allowed character length of event descriptions created using the Discourse Calendar plugin.

By default, the Calendar plugin enforces a hard-coded limit of 1000 characters for event descriptions. This plugin removes that limitation and allows admins to define their own maximum length through a site setting.
